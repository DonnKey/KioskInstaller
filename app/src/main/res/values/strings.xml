    <string name="introduction">This application was used to install the application named below as a Kiosk application.
    Under normal circumstances, you should not need to run this again. However, if that application has
    lost the privileges needed to be a Kiosk application, this application can restore that. The most likely cause
    is that you uninstalled and reinstalled the application.\n
    \nClicking "Reenable" below will restore those privileges.\n
    \nClicking "Reinstall" below will install the application from the source named below (and reenable it).\n
    \nIt is difficult, but not impossible, to remove this application from your device, and
    doing so has potential undesirable consequences.
    \nSee https://foo/bar for details on how and when to do that.
