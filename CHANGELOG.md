### Initial Creation (v1.0.0)

Created in response to needing a way to QR (or NFC) install the Aesop Player application
while keeping it up to date using Play Store.

Feel free to adapt this any way you wish as long as you preserve the license.
It uses the the MIT License. I'm happy to collaborate on changes. 
Contact me at aesopPlayer@gmail.com or via GITHub.
If I don't respond within a few days, just go ahead... I'll respond when I can.

The README (which you've probably read) has all the major information.

### V1.0.1

Documentation changes, particularly for NFC Installer and a minor bugfix.
